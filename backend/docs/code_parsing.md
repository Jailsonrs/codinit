LibCST, or the "LibCST Python Concrete Syntax Tree", is a Python library developed by Instagram for parsing Python source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

The idea behind using LibCST is to take Python source code and convert it into a more structured form (an AST) that we can navigate programmatically. This allows us to analyze the structure of the Python source code, identify its components, and extract relevant information.

In the code snippets I provided, I used LibCST to parse the Python source code and then navigated the resulting AST to identify various components, such as import statements, classes, and functions.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening:

1. `module = libcst.parse_module(file_content)`: This line takes the Python source code (stored as a string in `file_content`) and parses it into an AST, which is stored in module.
2. After the `module` AST has been created, we iterate over its children (the top-level components of the Python source code) with the for node in `module.children:` loop.
3. Within this loop, we check the type of each node (each top-level component of the source code). We're specifically looking for import statements, classes, and functions, as these are the components you're interested in for your knowledge graph.
4. For each type of component, we do two things:
 - Create an entity representing that component (like an import statement, class, or function). For example, for an import statement, we create an entity with a unique ID and the name of the import.
 - Create a relationship from the file to the entity. This is based on your schema, where a file "has" import statements, classes, and functions. For each entity, we create a relationship where the "from" is the file and the "to" is the entity.
In general, the LibCST library is a powerful tool for analyzing Python source code, and it's used in a variety of applications, such as code linting, refactoring, and generating documentation. Its ability to parse Python code into an AST makes it possible to programmatically navigate and analyze the structure of Python code.

## Module Imports

`libcst.ImportFrom` objects represent import statements of the form `from module import something`. The module being imported from is represented by the `.module` attribute, and the names being imported are represented by the `.names` attribute, which is a list of `libcst.ImportAlias` objects.

For an import statement of the form `from module import function, Class`, you'd have a `libcst.ImportFrom` object with a `libcst.Name` object representing "module" as the `.module`, and a list of `libcst.ImportAlias` objects representing "function" and "Class" as the `.names`.
